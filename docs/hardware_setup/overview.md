# Hardware Setup Overview

The following pages guide you on how to setup the hardware of your robot (either DiffBot or Remo).

- [**3D Printing**](3D_print.md) is only relevant for Remo robot (not DiffBot). 
  Here you will learn which parts to print and some suggestions to configure your slicer.
- [**Electronics**](electronics.md) provides instructions to connect the single board computer (e.g. Raspberry Pi), microcontroller (e.g. Teensy) as well as
  the other components such as the motor driver, motors and laser scanner.

    ??? info "Preview of connection schematic"
        The bread board view from [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) shows the connection schematic. Both models (DiffBot and Remo) use
        slgithly different hardware (e.g. motor driver) which you can see in the following:

- [**Assembly**](assembly.md) give instructions to assemble Remo robot.
